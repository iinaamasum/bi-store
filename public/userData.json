Narrowing the gap between functionality and bike art, Vaux strikes the fine balance for Cycling enthusiasts. We got the opportunity to test ride the Vaux Joggers and here is what I thought.\r\n"

The seat tube has a unique dual tube design and it joins the bottom bracket which looks good and makes the bicycle look big. The fat tires have an artistic tread pattern.\r\n"
